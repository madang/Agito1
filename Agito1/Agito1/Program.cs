 * 5.then sort those words (using QuickSort implementation of algorithm that can be found in .NET Base Class Library) 
 * 6.and write the sorted words into a new text file onto the disk.
 */

/* Comments on the task:
 * 
 * 2. and 3. I assume from what is written in 3. that there should be no punctuation 
 * just spaces,newlines and words from alphabetic characters.
 * First I didn't assume that but then after re-reading the task this is how I interpret it.
